📧 Gmail Console Application (Java)
📌 Project Description

This project is a console-based Gmail-like email application developed using Core Java.
It simulates real-world email functionalities such as account creation, login, composing mails, inbox management, trash handling, and starred mails using OOP principles and Java Collections.
This application is designed to strengthen understanding of Encapsulation, Has-A relationship, and real-life system flow, and it can be easily extended into a REST API in the future.
